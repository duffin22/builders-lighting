## Summary

This Builders Lighting application is a tool for lighting contractors to keep track of required items for large-scale ordering. The app allows contractors to easily keep track of items required while out on site visits with a well-defined project structure. Users can sync this information with the builders lighting website and quickly complete the ordering process from there.

The screenshots above show four different scenarios within the application.
 - The first is the login page, with a clean and intuitive interface.
 - The second is the homepage, where the user can view all of their active projects.
 - The third shows the details tab of the individual project screen.
 - The fourth shows the navigation drawer, which is viewable throughout the application to allow users to easily navigate.
